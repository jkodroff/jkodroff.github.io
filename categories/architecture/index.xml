      <description>Way back in November, I gave a talk at BarCamp Philly. BarCamp Philly is a local unconference and one of my favorite events in the Philly tech community. If you&amp;rsquo;re in Philly, or a few hours&amp;rsquo; drive away, you should definitely check it out. There&amp;rsquo;s all kinds of talks on all types of subjects, from the technical to the decidedly non-technical.
In the talk I gave, I coined the phrase &amp;ldquo;Bronze Bullet Architecture&amp;rdquo; to describe my technical approach to building message-based, domain-driven line of business software, and explained you how my professional experience helped me arrive at this style.</description>
