  <div class="entry-content"><h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>For developers using <a href="https://entityframework.codeplex.com/">Entity Framework</a>, unit testing code that depends on the <code>DbContext</code> class is not the easiest thing.  If we&rsquo;re interested in doing unit testing, we need to be able to use an in-memory (&ldquo;fake&rdquo; in <a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/mocksArentStubs.html">Martin Fowler&rsquo;s terminology</a>) version of <code>DbContext</code> comprised of lists of objects so that our tests do not hit the database.  This series of posts takes you through my process in getting to a facade on top of Entity Framework that results in testable code and tests that are fast to write.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I attended the <a href="http://dotnetfringe.org/">DotNetFringe</a> conference in Portland in April, and I met some some fantastic people, learned a ton, and had an overall great time. The conference was focused on open source in the .NET ecosystem, and I&#8217;m definitely an advocate for both of those things.</p>

<p>While I&#8217;ve been a consumer of much open source software for a long time, <a href="https://github.com/jkodroff">I&#8217;m not where I&#8217;d like to be in terms of giving back to the community</a> (i.e. there ain&#8217;t a lot of green on my contrib chart at the time of writing this post). I want that to change, so I&#8217;m committing (pun sorta-intentional) to doing 1 pull request per month for projects on <a href="http://up-for-grabs.net/#/">Up For Grabs</a> projects.</p>

<p>And what is Up for Grabs? Up For Grabs is a project created by <a href="https://lostechies.com/keithdahlby/">Keith Dahlby</a> of <a href="http://dahlbyk.github.io/posh-git/">posh-git</a> fame. Basically, you add your project to a manifest of open source projects and associate a GitHub issue tag with what I like to call &#8220;shovel-ready&#8221; issues: issues which the maintainers have oked so you know that the PR is likely to be approved. I think this is a fantastic idea and really helps lower the barrier to entry for becoming an OSS contributor.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re a project maintainer, you should list your project with Up For Grabs. If you want to get more involved as a contributor, you should gind some issues on Up For Grabs. Big thanks to Keith for making this happen.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I find myself in the incredibly fortunate position of having a skill set that is greatly in demand. I get calls and emails on a near-daily basis from recruiters for all types of jobs. (If you don&#8217;t think that having recruiters contact you on a daily basis is a good problem to have, I would advise you to consider the employment circumstances of anyone else who is not a medical or IT professional, i.e. the other 99.999% of the world.) While there&#8217;s a lot to like about my current position, it would be foolish to be closed to new opportunities if the right one comes up. But how do I now what &#8220;the right opportunity&#8221; looks like? My answer: The Josh Test.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>At one of the places I&#8217;ve been employed in my career (an agency), there was a big emphasis on &#8220;consistency&#8221;. Our employees worked on multiple projects and the theory went that if all of our projects were consistent in their use of coding standards, tools, workflows, etc our productivity would increase and therefore our profits would likewise increase.</p>

<p>I would consider myself a good developer. When I see potential improvements in how software can be developed, then I want to incorporate that feedback into my process immediately and reap the results. That&#8217;s what agile is all about when you get down to it &#8211; gathering constant feedback, incorporating it into your process, and reaping the benefits of continuous improvement.</p>

<p>Rigid development processes are like recipes &#8211; they&#8217;re for novices so that they can keep themselves out of trouble. Your best developers, the (true) experts, the people who innovate and <a href="http://haacked.com/archive/2007/06/25/understanding-productivity-differences-between-developers.aspx">deliver the maximum value for your organization</a> are hampered by recipes. So why would you want to force a process upon your best developers which hampers their ability to solve problems?</p>

<p>One good answer might be that you charge the same hourly rate for all your employees and your novices bring your highest profit margins. If that&#8217;s the case, then your highest profit employees actually bring the least value to your customers and I&#8217;d suggest you consider differentiating your rates. You&#8217;ll be able to pay your best employees the most (because you&#8217;ll charge the most for them) and your best employees will deliver the most value (because their rates relative to their productivity provide the best value to clients). It&#8217;s a win-win.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>At work, I use a MacBook Pro and boot into Windows directly using BootCamp. I tried using <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a> but key bindings not matching up drove me nuts and I was trying to get a project launched on a tight deadline, so I went with what I knew.</p>

<p>As a reward for launching said project, I got myself a nice new MacBook Pro for home use with a Retina screen, and 16 GB RAM. Professional tools for a professional developer and whatnot.</p>

<p>So I&#8217;m doing a little extra studying on <a href="http://tekpub.com/">TekPub</a> in my off-hours, watching <a href="http://tekpub.com/productions/nsb/1">Udi Dahan&#8217;s intro to NServiceBus</a>. I&#8217;ve never taken Udi&#8217;s course so I wanted to make sure I hadn&#8217;t missed anything that could make my work significantly easier.</p>

<p>Long story short, I found some code that I wanted to try out here at home so I start looking into what it would take for me to have my own legal copies of my work development environment. What I found did not make me very happy:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="https://buy.parallels.com/329/purl-us-pd8f">Parallels Desktop for Mac 8: $79.99</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/en_US/pdp/productID.278119500?mr:referralID=a9233989-bd09-11e2-9dea-001b2166becc">Windows 8 Professional: $199.99</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/en_US/pdp/productID.254640600?mr:referralID=c120e554-bd09-11e2-9dea-001b2166becc">Visual Studio 2012 Professional: $499.99</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/buy/index.jsp">ReSharper 7 Personal License: $199.99</a></li>
</ol>


<p>Total: <strong>$979.96</strong></p>

<p>So I&#8217;ll be out about a grand before I can set up a machine to do a little extra .NET learning at home? Ouch. Each of these by themselves isn&#8217;t terribly unreasonable (with the possible exception of Visual Studio) however, the problem is that in total it&#8217;s making it damn near impossible to continue to work with .NET (while obeying the license terms) in my spare time. If Microsoft wants to keep up with their open source competition for my development talent (for whatever that&#8217;s worth), then they need to get the cost down. <em>A lot.</em></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In my view, there&#8217;s 2 main principles that distinguish Domain-driven design as an approach to solving problems:</p>

<ol>
<li>All solutions to problems are framed in terms of the value delivered to the stakeholders for the effort required.</p></li>
<li>The core of the code is a model of the business process, and it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring">evolves with time</a> as the  developers&#8217; understanding of the business with time.</li>
