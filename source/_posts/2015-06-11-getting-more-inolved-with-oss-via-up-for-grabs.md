I attended the [DotNetFringe][1] conference in Portland in April, and I met some some fantastic people, learned a ton, and had an overall great time. The conference was focused on open source in the .NET ecosystem, and I&#8217;m definitely an advocate for both of those things.

While I&#8217;ve been a consumer of much open source software for a long time, [I&#8217;m not where I&#8217;d like to be in terms of giving back to the community][2] (i.e. there ain&#8217;t a lot of green on my contrib chart at the time of writing this post). I want that to change, so I&#8217;m committing (pun sorta-intentional) to doing 1 pull request per month for projects on [Up For Grabs][3] projects.

And what is Up for Grabs? Up For Grabs is a project created by [Keith Dahlby][4] of [posh-git][5] fame. Basically, you add your project to a manifest of open source projects and associate a GitHub issue tag with what I like to call &#8220;shovel-ready&#8221; issues: issues which the maintainers have oked so you know that the PR is likely to be approved. I think this is a fantastic idea and really helps lower the barrier to entry for becoming an OSS contributor.

If you&#8217;re a project maintainer, you should list your project with Up For Grabs. If you want to get more involved as a contributor, you should gind some issues on Up For Grabs. Big thanks to Keith for making this happen.
