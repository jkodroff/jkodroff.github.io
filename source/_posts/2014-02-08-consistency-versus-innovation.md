At one of the places I&#8217;ve been employed in my career (an agency), there was a big emphasis on &#8220;consistency&#8221;. Our employees worked on multiple projects and the theory went that if all of our projects were consistent in their use of coding standards, tools, workflows, etc our productivity would increase and therefore our profits would likewise increase.

I would consider myself a good developer. When I see potential improvements in how software can be developed, then I want to incorporate that feedback into my process immediately and reap the results. That&#8217;s what agile is all about when you get down to it &#8211; gathering constant feedback, incorporating it into your process, and reaping the benefits of continuous improvement.

Rigid development processes are like recipes &#8211; they&#8217;re for novices so that they can keep themselves out of trouble. Your best developers, the (true) experts, the people who innovate and [deliver the maximum value for your organization][1] are hampered by recipes. So why would you want to force a process upon your best developers which hampers their ability to solve problems?

One good answer might be that you charge the same hourly rate for all your employees and your novices bring your highest profit margins. If that&#8217;s the case, then your highest profit employees actually bring the least value to your customers and I&#8217;d suggest you consider differentiating your rates. You&#8217;ll be able to pay your best employees the most (because you&#8217;ll charge the most for them) and your best employees will deliver the most value (because their rates relative to their productivity provide the best value to clients). It&#8217;s a win-win.
