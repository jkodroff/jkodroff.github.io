I did something cool tonight (relatively speaking): I published my first NuGet package.

I&#8217;ve got these general-purpose extension methods that I find useful &#8211; stuff like `ForEach()` for collections and `ToFormat()` for strings &#8211; and I figured that if they&#8217;re that useful for me, they&#8217;re probably useful for other people as well. So, I decided to share.

The project is called UnderSharp. It&#8217;s designed to be to C# what [Underscore][1] is to JavaScript &#8211; some damn useful utility methods.

I&#8217;d love for you to check it out, give it a spin, and let me know what you think. And if you&#8217;re really inspired, [fork me][2]!
