Way back in November, I gave a talk at BarCamp Philly.  BarCamp Philly is a local unconference and one of my favorite events in the Philly tech community.  If you're in Philly, or a few hours' drive away, you should definitely check it out.  There's all kinds of talks on all types of subjects, from the technical to the decidedly non-technical.

In the talk I gave, I coined the phrase "Bronze Bullet Architecture" to describe my technical approach to building message-based, domain-driven line of business software, and explained you how my professional experience helped me arrive at this style.  I also used Kanye West album covers to denote the various years in my career.  Anyway, talk slides follow:
